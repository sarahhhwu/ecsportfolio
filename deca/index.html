        <h4>What is DECA?</h4>
        <p>DECA is a non-profit ogranization that helps prepare emerging leaders and entrpreneurs for careers like management, finance, hospitality, and marketing (my favorite)</p>
        <h4>My biggest influence:</h4>
        <p>My cousin was the biggest influence on my interest for DECA. He was able to win 2nd at nationals last year and is really passionate about business. He's graduating this year and majoring in economics :).</p>
